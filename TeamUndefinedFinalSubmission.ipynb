    "Over the course of this semester we have all learned a lot more about supervised machine learning. For this project specifically, we had the chance to try out many different machine learning models, and we learned the challenges of working with real world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our biggest take away was definitely that certain models are built to work with certain kinds of data and exploration is paramount in finding approaches that work for your data set. In early runs of this project, we tried using a k nearest neighbor approach (KNeighborsRegressor) and a random forest approach (RandomForestRegressor). Both of these models did not work well with our data. We then tried a LinearRegressor which worked better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned not to give up on a particular algorithm, because variants of it may yeild better results. For example, even though RandomForestRegressor didn't work well, we found that other tree ensembles, specifically gradient boosted algorithms like LightGBM and XGBoost, worked very well on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas that we had and did not try were using time series specific models and preprocessing. This task is ultimately a time series forecasting task, so using models from a library like sktime could lead to better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, this has been a very exciting semester and a great experience. Through taking this class, we have laid a strong foundation for future learning in the machine learning field."
